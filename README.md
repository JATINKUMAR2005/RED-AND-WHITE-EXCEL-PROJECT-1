- Data formatting (bold, italic, currency, date, custom formats)

### 2. **IF Formulas**
- Basic IF statements
- Nested IF formulas
- IF with AND/OR conditions

### 3. **Statistical Functions**
- COUNTIFS - Count with multiple criteria
- SUMIFS - Sum with conditions
- AVERAGEIFS - Average with conditions

### 4. **Lookup Functions**
- VLOOKUP - Vertical lookup
- XLOOKUP - Modern flexible lookup
- XMATCH - Position matching
- INDEX/MATCH - Dynamic searches

### 5. **Text Functions**
- LEFT, RIGHT, MID - Extract text
- FIND, SEARCH - Locate text
- UPPER, LOWER, PROPER - Change case
- CONCATENATE/TEXTJOIN - Combine text

### 6. **Dynamic References**
- INDIRECT - Dynamic cell references
- OFFSET - Dynamic range creation

### 7. **Date/Time Functions**
- Date calculations
- Age calculations
- Date differences

### 8. **Math Functions**
- ROUND, CEILING, FLOOR
- Financial calculations

### 9. **FILTER Function**
- Extract data based on conditions
- Return multiple values dynamically

## 🛠️ Main Tasks

### Task 1: Grade Classification
Apply IF formulas to classify student grades based on their scores.

**Example:**
- Score ≥ 90: Grade A
- Score ≥ 80: Grade B
- Score ≥ 70: Grade C
- And so on...

### Task 2: Student Count Analysis
Use COUNTIFS to count students scoring above 60 in specific subjects.

### Task 3: Product Price Lookup
Use VLOOKUP to find product prices from sales data tables.

### Task 4: Employee Salary Retrieval
Apply XLOOKUP to fetch employee salaries dynamically without column restrictions.

### Task 5: Date Analysis
Format and analyze employee date of joining to calculate tenure, experience, etc.

### Task 6: Top Performers Extraction
Use FILTER function to extract students with grades above 80.

## 📊 Essential Practice Exercises

### **Conditional Logic**
- Classify students' grades based on scores
- Compute discounts for sales based on price thresholds
- Identify students scoring above 80 in both Math & Science using IF(AND())
- Determine product discount eligibility using IF(OR())

### **Statistical Analysis**
- Count students who scored above 50 in Math
- Sum total sales for specific regions and products
- Calculate average scores for students above 60

### **Data Retrieval**
- Fetch student names based on ID
- Retrieve product prices based on product codes
- Find sales values for specific salesperson in specific months
- Look up employee details dynamically

### **Text Manipulation**
- Extract first names from full names using LEFT and FIND
- Convert names to uppercase/lowercase

### **Advanced Lookups**
- Search for salesperson performance with flexible criteria
- Find employee salaries without sorted data requirements
- Find product positions in sales lists

### **Dynamic References**
- Create dynamic cell range references using INDIRECT
- Build dynamic ranges for sales trends using OFFSET

### **Date Calculations**
- Calculate age from date of birth
- Find differences in days between dates

### **Math Operations**
- Apply ROUND(), CEILING(), and FLOOR() for financial calculations
